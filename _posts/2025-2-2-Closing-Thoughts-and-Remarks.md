This project was a great learning experience for stepping into the basics of VR development within Unity. 
From how the playtesters managed the course, I also think I succeeded in creating an intuitive one-handed system of interaction. Players were able to run the course with no outside help, and successfully did every feature within the game, although it definetly needs some refining for its visuals and object interaction.  I encountered a lot of difficulties in trying to get my original vision of a fully physics based movement, and then with actually getting the apk to work, but it was a learning experience on how the meta SDK works in Unity, when you should pivot and try new things, and how sometimes a simple implementation gets the same idea across. In the future, I plan on going back to my object interaction method and smoothing it out, hopefully eliminating the shakey hands issue that is present, but I also want to mess around with other forms of interaction and see what sticks. I'm looking forward to using what I learned in my next project, and already have some ideas for future VR games!
