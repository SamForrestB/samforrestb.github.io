With a basic interaction method, its time to get some live feedback.
I was able to get three people to try out the locomotion technique: My friends Caden and Thomas, and my roomate Sally.
Caden was the only one who had some familiarity with VR applications, having reguarly played on the Quest 2, while Thomas and Sally both had next to no experience interacting with VR.

For my testing I wanted to test three things: How fast a player is able to perform each feature in the game without being told how to do it, How players react to the interaction task, and How long it takes them to complete the course.
I would sit each player down and instruct them on how to open the application, and told them that while they are playing they should speak their thoughts out loud. 
I then would explain that you can move around the course with your hand, and that their goal would be to collect coins, complete the interaction task before every banner, and reach the finish line.

### Caden

Caden was the first tester, and he managed to complete the course in 10 minutes and 37 seconds. 
After he started the application, it took him only 1 second to learn how to rotate the hand, as he looked left and right once the game started. 
He was a little surprised to be rotating at first, but caught on and begun moving the hand forward after about 10 seconds.
Caden made sure to grab every coin he could for the first part of the course, and looked to be moving fairly rapidly throgh it also.
When he came to the first interaction task, he almost ran right through it, but stopped and turned around once he saw the buttons appear. 
He tried to run into them at first, but when that didn't work he tried using his left hand.
Seeing that his left hand didn't work, he went back to trying his right, and then flipped it, triggering the mode change at 1 minute and 52 seconds.
He started the task, pointed towards the object, and grabbed it at 2 minutes and 10 seconds.
He had some trouble with the first object as he was getting used to grabbing and moving, and accidentally skipped the third object by pressing done, but in the end he completed the first interaction task by 4 minutes and 3 seconds.
The rest of the course was what I expected, but when he reached the floating coins, he did an almost perfect jump at 7 minutes and 51 seconds.
I was very surprised as he hadn't done a single jump the entire time, and he managed to get almost every coin in the arc of the jump.
After he finished, his biggest complaint was how shakey the object grabbing and moving was, and that it you could accidentally have your hand over the done button and skip an object, but otherwise he said he liked moving around and how you could jump.

### Thomas

Thomas was able to complete the course in 9 minutes and 41 seconds.
Like Caden, he rotated the hand within the first 5 seconds, and then begun moving forward at the 13 second mark.
As he was moving to collect coins, he accidentally triggered a jump at 39 seconds, and was very surprised to suddenly be in the air.
He then begun to try and trigger another jump, and spent some time jumping in the air.
He continued to collect the final bit of coins and reached the interaction task, and changed to the interaction mode at 1 minute and 40 seconds.
Thomas grabbed the first object at 2 minutes and 20 seconds, but didn't try to perfectly allign the objects like Caden attempted, and finished the interaction task at 3 minutes and 28 seconds.
After he passed through the banner, he continued collecting coins and jumping around, but accidentlly gained too much speed and zoomed past the second interaction task and into the banner, which got rid of the task.
He asked if he needed to restart but I told him it was fine, and he continued but went noticeably slower through the final leg of the course.
When he reached the last interaction task, he tried to align the objects to the best of his ability, but was having difficulties moving it to the correct angle.
His final thoughts were again that moving objects was a hassle with how much you have to move if you want to get it in the correct position, and that rotating is a little too fast for him.

### Sally
