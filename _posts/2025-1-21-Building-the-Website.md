I've been putting it off for so long but its time to finally get this website up and running.

Using my available github page, I've forked the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), which is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme that helps give the blog some formatting and has a bunch of build in things.

Hopefully, this should make it to where formatting on mobile and on the computer isn't a pain, and that adding new blog posts is smooth.
