I've been putting it off for so long but its time to finally get this website up and running.

Using my available github page, I've forked the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), which is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme that helps give the blog some formatting and has a bunch of build in things.

Hopefully, this should make it to where formatting on mobile and on the computer isn't a pain, and that adding new blog posts is smooth.

In order to upload the gifs and videos for my posts I ended up having to download Github Desktop and set up Github Large File Storage for the repository, which ended up being harder than I thought because this repo was a fork. 
For some reason, large file storage doesn't work on forks of public repositories, so I had to disconnect this fork from the original repo, and only then could I upload the large files I needed to upload.
Other than that hiccup, this has exposed me to more of the github ecosystem, something that I desperately need to familiarize myself with if I am to continue developing VR applications in the future.
